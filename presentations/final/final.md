# Classical <br>Zero-knowledge

Verifier learns no information he can't *efficiently* compute himself.

This is formalised by showing that verifier has a *simulator* which can simulate prover-verifier interaction **in polynomial time**.

# GKR

*G*oldwasser, *K*alai, and *R*othblum described a interactive proof protocol which allows verifier to solve most problems in $\mathsf{P}$ **much** faster than it would be possible without prover.

Specifically, in **quasi-linear** time doing little more than reading the input.

# Precise <br>Zero-knowledge

Verifier learns no information he can't *efficiently* compute himself.

This is formalised by showing that verifier has a *simulator* which can simulate prover-verifier interaction **in time proportional to verifier's runtime**.
